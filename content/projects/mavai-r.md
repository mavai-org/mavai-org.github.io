**mavai-R** is the statistical oracle for the mavai project family. It uses R — the gold standard for statistical computing — to generate language-agnostic reference datasets against which all mavai framework implementations verify their statistics engines.

## Why it exists

The mavai family includes multiple independent implementations of the same statistical methodology: [punit](/projects/punit/) (Java), [feotest](/projects/feotest/) (Rust), [baseltest](/projects/baseltest/) (Python), and future frameworks in other languages. Each implements Wilson score confidence intervals, threshold derivation, power analysis, feasibility checking, and verdict evaluation independently, in its own language and idiom.

mavai-R provides the shared truth. If your implementation produces results that match the R-generated reference data within stated tolerances, it conforms. No need to trust a Java or Rust implementation — the expected outputs come from R's well-vetted statistical functions.

## What it covers

| Suite                | Covers                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Wilson CI            | Two-sided Wilson score confidence intervals      |
| Wilson lower bound   | One-sided Wilson score lower bound               |
| Threshold derivation | Sample-size-first and threshold-first approaches |
| Power analysis       | Sample size calculation via power analysis       |
| Feasibility          | Verification feasibility checking                |
| Verdict evaluation   | Pass/fail determination with z-test statistics   |

Each suite is published as a JSON file containing test cases with inputs, expected outputs, and a tolerance for floating-point comparison. Framework conformance tests read these files and assert that every computation matches.

## The Statistical Companion

mavai-R hosts the [Statistical Companion](https://r.mavai.org/statistical-companion.pdf) — the formal mathematical foundation for the entire mavai methodology. This document provides a rigorous treatment of the hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, power analysis, and threshold derivation methods that all mavai frameworks implement.

It also hosts the [Distributional Contracts](https://r.mavai.org/distributional-contracts.pdf) paper, which extends Bertrand Meyer's Design by Contract to stochastic systems by lifting postconditions from Boolean predicates to statistical assertions.

## Designed to grow

mavai-R is structured as a proper R package, versioned and installable. Its current focus is statistics engine conformance, but it is designed to expand into design of experiments (DoE) reference data as the mavai family's capabilities grow.
